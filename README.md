# <ins>**SFML Engine**</ins>

**My SFML Engine is a lightweight C++ engine built with [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library or SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org), with [Four Simple Games]() each showcasing new capabilities of the engine, implemented following the C++ Core Guidelines.**

# <ins>**Overview**</ins>

This Engine is built on the foundation of my [**Diji-Engine**](https://github.com/DijiOfficial/Diji-Engine), using [**SFML**]() over [**SDL**]() this project aims to improve my knowledge of programming, programming guidelines, game programming and learning capacities using new library.
Since it's based of my Diji-Engine the structure is based of the Unity Engine as well as The Unreal Engine using systems appropritate for my use case. With an Improved more robust Pipeline simplyfying systems while expanding on them.

The [**Four Games**]() included in this repo serves as proof of the engine's capabilites. A complete, [**playable example**]() that ties the engineâ€™s core systems together.

# The Engine

In this section I will cover the changes and improvements over my first engine. I won't go over the features and programming patterns as they are essentially the same as my [**Diji-Engine**](). I will instead cover the transition and differences with an extensive focus on the Improvements made.
